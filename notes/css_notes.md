# Summary of Files

## 1. `globals.css`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Contains global styles for your Next.js application.
  - Used to define base styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and other CSS properties.
  
- **Connection:** 
  - Imported in `layout.js` to apply styles across all pages and components.
  - Can include custom font declarations (e.g., `@font-face`) and default styles for HTML elements.

## 2. `layout.js`
- **Purpose:**
  - Defines the root layout for your Next.js application.
  - Wraps around all pages and components, providing a consistent structure and style (like headers, footers, and any global classes).

- **Connection:** 
  - Imports `globals.css` to ensure global styles are applied to all pages.
  - Can include additional font configurations (like custom fonts using `next/font`) and metadata for the application.
  
## 3. `tailwind.config.js`
- **Purpose:**
  - Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
  - Defines custom theme settings, such as colors, spacing, and fonts that Tailwind will use throughout your application.
  
- **Connection:** 
  - Allows you to extend or customize the default Tailwind styles, such as adding your custom fonts (like "Timmana").
  - Tailwind utility classes defined here can be used in `layout.js`, `globals.css`, and your components for consistent styling.

## Differences
- **Functionality:**
  - `globals.css` focuses on general styles and global settings.
  - `layout.js` organizes the overall structure of the application and applies global styles.
  - `tailwind.config.js` customizes the Tailwind CSS framework, defining utility classes and theming options.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Use `globals.css` for standard CSS and custom font declarations.
  - Use `layout.js` to create a consistent layout structure and ensure global styles are applied.
  - Use `tailwind.config.js` for extending Tailwind's functionality and customizing design tokens.

## Conclusion
These files work together to create a cohesive styling system in your Next.js application, with `globals.css` handling standard CSS, `layout.js` managing the layout, and `tailwind.config.js` providing Tailwind CSS customization.
